# Comments on R

This Repo is for teaching how to perform pull requests from GitHub as part of:

+ [Getting Started with Git and GitHub for R Users ](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-with-Git-and-GitHub-for-R-Users)
workshop.

## How to work with this Repro

1. Create a fork.
2. Edit file `20190524-Comments.Rmd` in Github.
    + Add your three comments.
    + Save the file in Github.
3. Then create a "New Pull Request"
4. Submit your pull request.

## Collaboration 

This is one way of collaborating with others. In reality you will most likely
need to follow some other workflow when creating pull requests. That is outside
the scope of the [Getting Started with Git and GitHub for R Users ](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-with-Git-and-GitHub-for-R-Users)
workshop.

## Outcome

The intention is to accept all the pull requests and let you see all the comments.
